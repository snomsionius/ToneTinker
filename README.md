## YOU WILL GET A VIRUS WARNING   
I hope that I can fix that in a future release.   
It will be flagged as Trojan:Win32/Sabsik.FL.A!ml by windows defender and tell you that it is dangerous.   
I guess that this comes from the program logging mouse movements and mouse actions such clicking to control certain elements of the application.

### What should you do ?   
1. Keep calm as the program is harmless.
2. Allow the tool on your pc and release it from quarantine if you want to use it.
3. If you do not like the idea of a program flagged as a trojan running on your pc, delete the application and its directories.
4. If you know python, you can review the code too. I will add it to the repository once I reformatted and commented it.
