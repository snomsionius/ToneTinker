## YOU WILL GET A VIRUS WARNING   
#### I hope that I can fix that in a future release.   

### What should you do ?   
If you trust my word that this tool is no threat, ignore this warning and allow this tool on your PC. You will,most likely, have to manually tell your ANTIVIRUS to allow it out of whatever quarantine it put it in.   

ToneTinker is an easy to use program that helps you install and manage all of you your ReShade installations and packages via one unified UI
